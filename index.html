        <h1>Yoon Joon So</h1>
        <p>Hi, welcome to my site. I go by Yoon. I graduated from USC in computer science in video games and I have
        been working in video games ever since. With that, I have stacked up plenty of game development experience, 
        but I realize I have very little web experience. I felt this course would help me understand this important field.
        I was born in Korea, but I grew up around the Cerritos area for most of my life, attending Whitney High School.
        For work I've lived in Oklahoma and Texas for a bit, but ended up moving back to the Cerritos area.</p>

            and getting certified in Spanish / Portuguese.</li>
            <li>Play video games. I like RPG and rhythm games the most.</li>
            <li>Go to the gym. I don't like to do much cardio, I tend to focus on weights.</li>
